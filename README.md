## How to run the code
1) Change the directory      
Eg. cd /home/sakshi/courses/CMSC733/sakshi_p1/Phase1/Code

3) Run the .py script       
python3 Wrapper.py --BasePath /home/sakshi/courses/CMSC733/sakshi_p1/Phase1/ --ImagesFolder Data/Train/Set3 --SaveFolderName Code/Results/Set3 

## Parameters 
1) BasePath : Location for Phase 1. Eg. /home/sakshi/courses/CMSC733/sakshi_p1/Phase1/
2) ImagesFolder: Location for image folder relative to the BasePath. Eg Data/Test/TestSet2
3) SaveFolderName: Location where you want to save the results relativ BasePath. Eg. Code/Results/TestSet2
